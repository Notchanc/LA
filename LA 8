Aim- To compute singular value decomposition of matrix

Q1 To perform singular value decomposition of a matrix

Code-

import numpy as np

A = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
])

u, s, vt = np.linalg.svd(A)

print("Matrix A:")
print(A)

print("\nu (left singular vectors):")
print(u)

print("\ns (singular values):")
print(s)

print("\nvt (right singular vectors, transposed):")
print(vt)

s_matrix = np.diag(s)
print("\ns as a diagonal matrix:")
print(s_matrix)
