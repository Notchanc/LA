Q1 To solve Linear Programming using Python

Code-

import cvxpy as cp

x1 = cp.Variable()
x2 = cp.Variable()

objective = cp.Minimize(x1 + 2 * x2)

constraints = [
    -x1 + x2 <= 1,
    x1 + 2 * x2 <= 6,
    x1 >= 0,
    x2 >= 0
]

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

problem.solve()

print("Optimal value:", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution:")
print(f"x1 = {x1.value}")
print(f"x2 = {x2.value}")
